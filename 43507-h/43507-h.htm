<h2><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Valle
Crucis Abbey.</h2>
<p>The venerable ruin of Abbey de Valle Crucis&mdash;in other
words, Abbey of the Vale of the Cross, or, as the Welsh call it,
Mynachlog y Glynn, Mynachlog Glynn Egwestl, Mynachlog Llan
Egwestl, Mynachlog Glyn Eliseg, and Mynachlog Pant y
Groes&mdash;is situated in a lovely and sequestered valley, about
two miles from Llangollen, on the right of the road towards
Ruthin, and is approached by most delightful routes.</p>
<p>We go over the Dee Bridge and follow the road to the left, or
we may take a walk for about a mile along the canal side (reached
by the footpath leading through the wicket nearly opposite the
Railway Station), passing over the third bridge, before reaching
Pentrefelin Slate Wharf, into the road again.&nbsp; About a
quarter of a mile further on there is a gate leading to a field
on the right, through which a path wends right to the grand old
Abbey.&nbsp; Those more inclined to drive the distance can have
their demands satisfied at reasonable charges at the cab-stand
and the hotels; while to those who would prefer gliding along the
smooth water of the canal as far as Pentrefelin Wharf, ample
opportunity is afforded by pleasure boats, which run at intervals
daily in that direction.&nbsp; Or the place may be reached by
travelling per rail to Berwyn Station, then crossing the Dee by
the Chainbridge, whence the distance to the Abbey is only half a
mile.</p>
<p>The sequestered spot on which was built the Abbey in the year
1,200, by Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor, Lord <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>of Dinas
Br&agrave;n, and from which it takes its name, was known as
Pant-y-Groes, or the Glen of the Cross, long prior to that
time.&nbsp; It was so called from a very ancient inscribed pillar
or cross, the mutilated remains of which stand in an adjacent
field.</p>
<p>The Abbey was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and belonged to a
community of Cistercian monks, an order founded in France in the
year 1098.&nbsp; The remains of the Abbey Church are the most
entire and picturesque part; but adjoining the southern side are
the remains of the Abbot&rsquo;s lodgings, consisting of the
chapter house and dormitories above.</p>
<p>The church was built in the form of a cross, which was
contrary to the form in common use prior to the twelfth century,
and it is hence inferred that Madog availed himself of the aid of
the Free Masons, as they were incorporated about this time, and
were the chief undertakers of such works.&nbsp; Sir Christopher
Wren, in his Parentalia, describes their government as regular,
and they were wont to make an encampment in huts.&nbsp; A
surveyor governed in chief; every tenth man being called a warden
and overlooking nine.&nbsp; They ranged from country to country
as they found churches to be built, and are supposed to have
first introduced the cruciform style for religious edifices.</p>
<p>The eastern end of the church appears the most ancient, and
the three lancet-like windows have a very peculiar effect.&nbsp;
The northern side has been almost destroyed, and there is no
vestige of the roof except in the eastern side of the southern
transept.&nbsp; The choir was without aisles, but each transept
had one on the east side, which seem to have been used as
chapels.</p>
<p>The west front of the church affords some admirable specimens
of ancient Gothic architecture.&nbsp; The chief entrance was
through the ornamental pointed-arch gateway at the west end, over
which is a fine window, consisting of three lancet-shaped arches,
surmounted by a circular or rose window of eight divisions.&nbsp;
Above <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>this
window are the remains of a mutilated inscription, of which the
following is probably a correct translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Abbot Adam did this work.&nbsp; May he
rest in happy peace.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>High up in the southern wall is to be seen a small loop-hole,
communicating with a passage which leads over the vaulting of the
southern transept aisle to the abbatial building adjoining the
church.&nbsp; This passage is now blocked up, but it is
conjectured to have served either as a closet wherein the Abbot
could attend service privately, or else as a place of confinement
or penitence for the monks.&nbsp; The architecture of this
portion of the church corresponds in its style with the date of
its erection, the commencement of the thirteenth century; the
lancets, with their mouldings, are strictly of that date, and the
capitals of the shafts, which are worked with great boldness, are
of the late Norman period, rather than of that which is called
early-pointed.</p>
<p>The side windows are each of two lights, the principal
arch-head being solid, but pierced with a single aperture divided
into six foliations.&nbsp; Above these three windows run a kind
of framework, similar in some respects to that at the eastern end
of the choir.&nbsp; On the external face of the western end are
two bold buttresses of a single stage, that on the south-eastern
side being pierced for loop-holes for a circular staircase formed
in the thickness of the walls and itself.</p>
<p>From some numerals attached to the inscription before
mentioned, it is inferred that the Abbey was in complete repair
in 1500; it is certain that it was dissolved in 1535, and its
rapid demolition shows that there was not much veneration
exhibited by the people of the district for this once elegant
structure, for many of the neighbouring churches benefited from
its spoliation.&nbsp; This was probably owing to the progress of
the Reformation.&nbsp; At Porkington, near Oswestry, the seat of
Lord Harlech, in the saloon of the mansion, is a curious
painting, part of the altar-piece of the Abbey; <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>and in one of
the dormitories was found a sepulchural monument, carved with
running foliage, with this broken inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic Jacet&mdash;Arvrvet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A perusal at this juncture of the following paper, read at a
Congress of the British Arch&aelig;ological Society, held at
Llangollen during the last week in August, 1877, by Mr. E. P.
Loftus Brock, F.S.A., one of the honorary secretaries, will be
advantageous:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The charming valley, surrounded with
pleasant hills, which shut it out of the world beyond, the hardly
audible ripple of the flowing streamlet, and the absence of any
prospect save of the enclosing hills, alike tell us that this is
the site of a monastery for monks of the Cistercian Order.&nbsp;
They would alone be sufficient to record it were the voice of
history silent and the architectural arrangements
untraceable.&nbsp; At the back of the dormitory fireplace is a
narrow room parallel with the former.&nbsp; It is probably the
muniment room, while I assign to the sacristan another small
apartment at right angles, since it communicated by a passage
over the vaulting of the south transept chapels with the niche
before alluded to.&nbsp; The cloister space has no trace of the
cloister buildings, but from the position of the corbels for the
roof-timbers, &amp;c., and from the absence of the remains, it is
probable that here, as in many cases elsewhere, they were formed
of wood.&nbsp; The foundation of Valle Crucis Abbey and its date
have indeed been subjects of much doubt.&nbsp; Sir W. Dugdale, on
the authority of Leland, rightly ascribed the foundation to Madog
ap Gruffydd Maelor, Prince of Powis, and assumed that this was
about <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1200.&nbsp; We are
indebted to an associate, Mr. Morris C. Jones, the active hon.
secretary of the Powys Land Club, for a discovery of no small
importance with reference to the history of the Abbey.&nbsp; By a
process of close reasoning he has demonstrated that one of the
charters supposed by Dugdale to have referred to another
building, in reality is the foundation charter of this Abbey,
granted by Madog.&nbsp; We learn by this discovery that Valle
Crucis was an offshot from the less celebrated but parent Abbey
of Strada Marcella, and that a few monks of that house were the
first occupants here.&nbsp; Philip is spoken of as being then the
prior, showing that before the granting of the charter much
preliminary work had been done.&nbsp; We may accordingly with
confidence consider him as the first prior, and place him at the
commencement of the scanty list of those whose names have been
recorded.&nbsp; The foundation charter is undated, and we are
therefore left no nearer to the verification of Dugdale&rsquo;s
guess, while Mr. Jones is led in support of his argument to
devote much of his reasoning to prove that this spot was known
then, and later by the old-sounding title of Llan Egwest.&nbsp;
It may be worth while here to say that one of the latest seals of
the Abbey <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>extant, in the Herald&rsquo;s office of a date early in
the sixteenth century, has this name on its legend, thus
indicating that even at this late date Valle Crucis was known by
its original name.&nbsp; The buildings of the Abbey afford a
perfect model, so far as they remain, of the arrangements of a
Cistercian House, and we will survey these in order.&nbsp; But it
might be as well to announce than since no correct plan of these
remains has yet been published, the council of this association
has determined to have engraved one which was carefully prepared
by the late Mr. S. Buckler, and which exists among many other
papers of considerable interest which he bequeathed to the
British Museum.&nbsp; The church is of the usual cruciform type,
an aisleless presbytery, transepts with two chapels forming an
eastern aisle to each.&nbsp; There has been a low square tower
over the crossing, and a nave of six bays with two side
aisles.&nbsp; The extreme length is 165 feet, length of transept
from north to south 98 feet, width of nave and aisles 67 feet 6
inches, width of chancel 30 feet, and of transept 30 feet.&nbsp;
It will be seen that the east and west gables are all but
perfect, and that the north and part of the south walls of the
chancel still remain.&nbsp; Also those of the south transept and
of the north aisle of the nave.&nbsp; The south wall of the nave
is almost perfect, but is hidden by the luxuriant ivy, which here
and elsewhere adds so greatly to the beauty of the building in
its state of ruin.&nbsp; The bases of the nave piers are
traceable&mdash;thanks to the careful clearance by Viscount
Dungannon and Mr. Wynne in 1854.&nbsp; The east end and the
transepts are designed in a severe style of the First Pointed
architecture, and the peculiar plaster buttresses of the exterior
are more curious than beautiful; the treatment certainly
indicates some local influence, but whether we should consider it
as derivable from Dublin, as a late writer suggests, or as
evidence of a Welsh school of architecture, is open to
question.&nbsp; The Principality is full of evidence of peculiar
treatment of architectural detail, both of early and of late
work, which seems to afford evidence that the old Welsh builders
were not content to copy the style prevalent in England, but
impressed upon them their own peculiar treatment.&nbsp; The lofty
eastern lancets spring from a height, which must always have
been, for the size of the church, remarkably little above the
pavement, and there is just a trace of a moulded arched label
over the two upper lancets.&nbsp; This arch probably indicated
the line of the presbytery, whether of arched boarding or of
vaulting.&nbsp; The corbel table around the presbytery and
transept walls is bold and peculiar, and is of two
patterns.&nbsp; The shafts internally afford some evidence
probably of an intention of vaulting the ceiling, which was never
carried out, and the sloping line of stone visible inside and out
in the walls seems to be indicative that the west end of the
chancel was once covered by a hipped roof.&nbsp; This could only
be prior to the erection of the central tower.&nbsp; The other
sloping line crossing is that of the roof of the
sacristan&rsquo;s passage to the loop.&nbsp; The slit on the
south side is from a curious little room and passage at the back
of the monks&rsquo; dormitory.&nbsp; A great many guesses have
been made to determine <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the use of this passage and the
loop-hole, probably from the abbot&rsquo;s oriel in St.
Bartholomew&rsquo;s, London; it has been called the abbot&rsquo;s
closet.&nbsp; It is, however, that for the sacristan, from which
he would watch the perpetual lamp of the sanctuary at
night.&nbsp; The high altar has not stood touching the east wall,
but away from it, as at Fountain&rsquo;s Abbey and many other
places.&nbsp; The aumbry in the south wall has a semicircular
arch, and has been double.&nbsp; The bases of the four altars of
the transept chapels are very apparent, and they have been
covered with arcading.&nbsp; They are attached, as is usual in
these positions, to the east walls.&nbsp; The intermediate arches
dividing the chapels have probably been filled in only to a
certain height, to allow of the picturesque effect being
preserved.&nbsp; Each of these altars is furnished with a
piscina.&nbsp; The northern altar of the northern transept has a
detached pillar piscina.&nbsp; The others have lockers in the
wall in several instances, and the elegant and early carving of
the brackets of the piscina will be observed with interest.&nbsp;
There are two floor drains to the north-east chapel.&nbsp; The
remaining arches of the transepts are designed in a very severe
style, and the capitals are a tradition of some building of
earlier date.&nbsp; The borders of the arches are simple
rectangles without even a chamfer, but the effect is
excellent.&nbsp; We may in the sheltered stonework of these
chapels observe that the whole surface of the wrought stone has
been covered with a film of plastering upon which coloured
decorations are still traceable here and there.&nbsp; This use of
colour was forbidden in Cistercian houses, and I am for one glad
to think that in some cases their rules were sometimes more
honoured in their breach than in their observance.&nbsp; The same
is observable at Old Cleeve Abbey.&nbsp; These traces of colour
have not, I believe, hitherto been noticed, and another feature
of interest may have attention directed to it.&nbsp; Many of the
stones have masons&rsquo; marks.&nbsp; I collected readily a
dozen or more different examples, besides others slightly
different or reversed, and they deserve comparison with those
that have been noted elsewhere.&nbsp; It has sometimes been
stated that all the buildings are of the same date, but a small
amount of inspection will assure us that the east end is the
oldest, say of a date within the first twenty years following
that of the foundation; the transepts a little later, and the
west front, as represented by its style, about 1,260.&nbsp; The
ground floor of the conventual buildings is of the same date as
the transepts, the style possibly older, but the dormitory floor
above is at least 150 years later than the foundation, since we
cannot assign an earlier date than the middle of the fourteenth
century.&nbsp; The square-headed doorways have the same flowing
mouldings as the windows; at this time the arches and flowing
tracery of the chapter-house were added into the older
openings.&nbsp; The western lancet of the south transept is
filled in with tracery of the fifteenth century date into the
older opening.&nbsp; There are traces of the use of stonework of
earlier date than in these buildings.&nbsp; The fireplace in the
muniment room has an inscription which has often been given,
which shows that it was once part of a <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>tombstone.&nbsp; The sill of the
little unglazed niche looking from the room at the end of the
dormitory into it has been part of an incised slab.&nbsp; The
present rough roof of the dormitory is modern, but the water
tables in the south transept gable show that it is of the same
pitch as the original one.&nbsp; The door in the south side of
the refectory is an unusual feature.&nbsp; It was probably for
hoisting up the trusses of straw for the monks&rsquo; beds, and
for the passage of articles which could not be brought up the
narrow day stairs.&nbsp; Several rectangular apartments are
indicated, and it is probable that the refectory extended north
and south.&nbsp; Just a trace of a wall at right angles to the
day-room going west may be traced among the farm appliances at
this corner, and also an angle buttress.&nbsp; All the walls are
constructed of their dark blue slaty stone, with dressings of
reddish freestone, all of great durability and excellent
workmanship.&nbsp; The main windows of the church are not rebated
for glass, and it is probable that they were filled in with
stained glass secured to the iron stanchion bars, which have been
numerous, and wedged into the stonework.&nbsp; Since these would
not be furnished with open casements, the ventilation of the
building has been assisted by several small square apertures, the
original putlog holes of the builders, but which are formed quite
through the walls.&nbsp; The income of Valle Crucis at the
dissolution was &pound;188 clear, and &pound;214 3s. 5d. gross,
and the largest of any Cistercian house in Wales; that of the
parent abbey of Ystrad Marchel was only &pound;64 14s. 2d.&nbsp;
The surrender was in the twenty-sixth Henry VIII., and was thus
among the lesser monasteries.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commenting upon the foregoing, a lady well versed in the
history of the Abbey writes that &ldquo;Valle Crucis Abbey was
founded, in 1199, by Madoc ap Gruffydd Maelor, Lord of Bromfield
and Yale, for Cistercian monks.&nbsp; Powell, in his <i>History
of Wales</i>, makes no mention of its having any connection
whatever with Strata Marcella, founded by his ancestor, Owen
Cyfeiliog, Prince of Powis, fifty years or more previously; and
no remark is made of Valle Crucis having had any of its revenues,
as none of the charters of Valle Crucis prove in any way that
such was the case.&nbsp; It would take thirty years at least to
build it, and, of course, changes would occur in that time.&nbsp;
The architecture is in this case an authority to go by: the east
end is the first transition from Norman to Early English; and a
few alterations have been made in the Church, the circular window
at the west end being of a later date and put in by, Adam the
Abbot about 1340.&nbsp; The <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>lancet window in the south aisle has
had tracing put in subsequently, but not in the fifteenth
century.&nbsp; What remains of the conventual buildings is the
Chapter-House, and the whole barn, and one of the
dormitories.&nbsp; The Cloisters which formed the square in front
are all destroyed.&nbsp; The Kitchen, Refectory, and Guest Hall
were on the south side of the Cloisters, which are also
destroyed.&nbsp; The Abbey was purchased by Mathew Trevor in
1620&ndash;1625, not from such a person as Cneifiwr Gl&acirc;s,
whom Mr. Pennant calls a low-lived partizan of Cromwell&rsquo;s
(I don&rsquo;t believe that Cromwell, as Protector of England,
would have companionship with such a low fellow).&nbsp; I have
seen the conveyance for purchase between Sir Thomas Trevor, his
Majesty (James I.), Lord Chief Justice, and Mathew Trevor, of
Trevor.&nbsp; I have this moment the panels of the pew doors in
Llantysilio Church, dated M.T. 1630, in my possession.&nbsp; The
Abbey was not dissolved before 1538, and it was destroyed at the
same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the removal of the rubbish in 1851, under the praiseworthy
superintendence of Viscount Dungannon, by which the whole of the
area was cleared, leaving the pavement and sides as they formerly
existed, some interesting discoveries were made; among others,
the tombs of benefactors buried in front of the high altar; a
half-length figure of a knight in chain armour&mdash;Jenaf ap
Adam of Trevor&mdash;and some fragments of his wife
Myfanwy&rsquo;s tombstone.&nbsp; Another of a lady, with the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic Jacet Gweirca filia Owein cuj.&nbsp;
Anim&aelig; propicietur Deus.&nbsp; A.M. 1290.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another tombstone has a wolf on a shield, with an imperfect
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Edwardus filius Yo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stone is curiously carved with a chase.&nbsp; A stone
coffin was also found in one of the side chapels; the bases of
five altars; a stone pulpit base, also those of the pillars that
divided the nave and aisles; a few <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>pieces of painted glass, and
encaustic tiles.&nbsp; A double benetoir, or holy water-vase, is
in the arch near the tomb in the north transept.</p>
<p>Previous to these discoveries, while digging in the farm-yard
adjoining for drainage purposes, at a short depth from the
surface, were found the remains of eleven men, in a very small
compass of ground, which goes far to prove that this was the
common cemetery of the monks; and also a wedge-like stone, having
carved on its front a hand, holding a vine or olive-branch,
bearing fruit.&nbsp; This stone was removed to Plas Newydd.</p>
<p>In this Abbey was also buried Iolo Goch, Lord of Llecryd,
Owain Glyndwr&rsquo;s bard.</p>
<p>The conventual buildings were re-roofed in 1878, after having
been sadly neglected for many years.</p>
<p>In the year 1879 the whole of the modern out-buildings in
close proximity to the Abbey were demolished, by which a far
better view of the ancient structure is now obtained.</p>
<p>Another improvement was commenced in the year 1883&mdash;the
clearing out of the chapter house, a part neglected and used as a
farm house for many generations.&nbsp; These excavations brought
to light the bases of the pillars.</p>
<p>There are some fine old trees on the grounds, dating, we
should say, three hundred years back, if not more; and hovering
always about this hallowed spot will be seen a number of
jackdaws, birds proverbially said to have a more than ordinary
regard for old ruins, an ascription which may account for the
fact that Valle Crucis Abbey is the only place in this part of
the country where they make their home.</p>
<p>The following were some of the endowments of the
Abbey:&mdash;Half the tithes of Wrexham, bestowed on it by
Reyner, bishop of St. Asaph, who died in 1224; and the other half
by his successor, Bishop Abraham, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>in 1227.&nbsp; And Howel ap Ednyfed,
another bishop, endowed it with those of Llangollen.&nbsp; The
monks also obtained the patronage of many other livings, such as
Wrexham, Rhiwabon, Chirk, Llansantffraid, and Llandegla; but
their title to these, as well as to Llangollen, was disputed by
Bishop Anian, commonly known by the name of <i>Y Brawd Du o
Nannau</i>, or the Black Brother of the House of Nanney, a
dominican consecrated in 1268, who brought his cause before the
Pope&rsquo;s delegate, the official of Canterbury, and the Abbot
of Taley, in Carmarthenshire, and obtained a decision in favour
of himself and his successors; but as there was some doubt as to
the patronage of the church of Llandegla, they allotted in lieu
of it to the Abbey a third of the tithes of Bryneglwys.&nbsp; In
the year 1291, the abbot was found to have, near the monastery, a
grange, with three plough lands, a mill, and other conveniences,
valued at &pound;3; the grange of Bod&euml;ang, Tregam, Rudrym,
and Backeton, set for &pound;5 10s.; the dairy farm of Nant, and
the grange of Nystroyz, Convereth, and Grenny-champt, set for
&pound;3 19s. 8d.; also the grange of Wyrcesham, consisting of
one plough land and some pasture, valued at 15s., and thirty cows
at the expense of 30s.</p>
<p>The freemen of Llangollen made a grant of a fishery to the
monks, in a part of the Dee near the town, and, for want of a
seal of their own, they affixed to their grant that of Madoc, the
founder of the Abbey.&nbsp; The monks soon afterwards erected new
works on the river, for the purpose of taking the fish; this
caused a dispute between them and the freemen; and these last
referred the matter for decision to the abbot and five monks of
their own choice, who were to determine the matter upon
oath.&nbsp; Madoc and his secretary, John Parvus, appointed a day
for the purpose; the assembly was held, the oaths solemnly
administered, and the abbot and monks made the decision (as might
have been expected), in their own favour.&nbsp; They alleged they
had <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>bought
the right of erecting what works they pleased, and of repairing
them, from the heirs of Llangollen.&nbsp; Madoc confirmed the
decree, and the donation of a fishery, by an instrument dated
1234.</p>
<p>The revenues of the monastery at the time of its dissolution,
in 1535, were &pound;188 per annum according to Dugdale, but
Speed reckons them at &pound;214 3s. 5d.&nbsp; The last abbot was
John Hern, who received an annuity of &pound;23 on his
surrender.&nbsp; This, together with &pound;10 13s. 4d. to some
of the brethren or surviving monks, were the only charges
remaining in 1553.&nbsp; It remained in the crown till the 9th of
James I., who granted it to Edward Wotton, afterwards created
Lord Wotton.&nbsp; In 1654, we find a lady, Margaret Wotton, a
recusant, to have been in possession, and that it was put under
sequestration by order of the commissioners of the ruling
powers.&nbsp; The Abbey now belongs to Rice Thomas, Esq., who is
the proprietor of the Trevor Hall Estate, and is under the charge
of the Rev. H. T. Owen, by whose kind permission the visitor, on
the payment of the small fee of 6d., may inspect the
interior.</p>
<p>Through the exertions of the Rev. H. T. Owen, some very
interesting excavations have been made of late years.&nbsp;
During the summer of 1888, Mr. Owen caused some investigations to
be made in the Monks&rsquo; Dormitory, for by removing surface
earth that accumulated there during the time it had been in
ruins, five very interesting sepulchral slabs were discovered of
very early date, not later than the tenth century.&nbsp; There is
one which has a Norman sword on it, and also an inscription which
cannot be deciphered but with some degree of uncertainty.&nbsp;
It can be read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jacet Oidus Madoc . . . Insignis Cele Ominu
Crucis,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which may be translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies Owi dus Madoc, a distinguished
Warrior of the Cross of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another stone contains a beautiful floriated cross with a
circle, which may be taken for the tombstone of an <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Abbot or
Bishop.&nbsp; There is another floriated circle, in splendid
condition, with no inscription whatever.&nbsp; The other two are
simply fragments, one having the point of a spear very distinct,
and on the other the old Grecian ornament.&nbsp; As these stones
form part of the vaulting of the slype, and are of much earlier
date than the present Abbey, and were inserted there when the
vaulting was erected, it is a certain proof that there must have
been a religious house here long before this edifice was
erected.&nbsp; Some antiquarians make out one stone to be
Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Hibernia.</p>
<p>During the year 1889, which was the year of the Queen&rsquo;s
visit to Llangollen, Mr. Owen started again to make further
excavations.&nbsp; This time he turned his attention to the
excavation of the exterior of the north transept and aisle, and
here he came upon the buttress of the north transept in splendid
condition, also the plinth and buttresses of the north aisle, and
at the north-west corner was found a magnificent buttress like a
turret tower, and all in excellent state, as sharp as if they had
been newly erected, although they had lain buried for centuries,
and would have been still buried only for the exertions of Mr.
Owen to make this noble ruins interesting to visitors.</p>
<p>In these excavations, between two buttresses, close to the
foundations, was discovered a very interesting stone, about 5 ft.
6 in. long, containing a Knight Templar&rsquo;s sword, or rather
a double-handled sword, beautifully sculptured at the foot.&nbsp;
This was a very interesting find, and well worth any one&rsquo;s
inspection, especially antiquarians, to whom it must be of great
interest, for this shows at once that the Knight Templars must
have had something to do with the Abbey either in its erection or
as Pilgrims.&nbsp; Or there is another theory respecting this
interesting stone:&mdash;Knight Templars were usually regarded as
the military, and it is possible that a Knight Templar might have
been killed in defending the Abbey in those troublous <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>times, and
possibly was buried close to the foundations, and this stone,
which has no inscription, erected to his memory.</p>
<p>In this excavation was found some beautiful specimens of old
stained glass of the thirteenth century, a few tiles, and several
pieces of molten lead, which is a certain proof that it had been
burnt down at some time or other, probably the same time as the
Castle of Dinas Br&agrave;n, during the last struggle of the
Welsh for their independency.</p>
<p>Valle Crucis now contains three things which are not found in
any other Abbey, viz., the oldest Stone known to antiquarians,
with a date on; Knight in Armour; and a Knight Templar&rsquo;s
tombstone.</p>
<p>Admission can be obtained by ringing the bell at the west
entrance, which will bring the custodian to the door, who, with
every courtesy, will conduct the visitor among the ruins and
answer any queries respecting the same.</p>
<h2>The Pillar of Eliseg.</h2>
<p>Leaving the Abbey, let us now proceed through the adjoining
meadow to the Pillar of Eliseg, to which we have previously
referred.&nbsp; It is situated in a field opposite the second
milestone from Llangollen, and stands on a slight elevation,
called Llwyn-y-Groes, or the Grove of the Cross.&nbsp; Similar
monuments were generally erected on a tumulus or sepulchral
mound, and inclosed in a grove.</p>
<p>It is among the first lettered stones that succeeded the
Meini-Hirion, Meini-Gwyr, and Llechau, and was erected by Concenn
ap Cateli, in memory of his great-grandfather Eliseg, whose son,
Brochmail Ysgythrog, <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Prince of Powys, grandfather of the
founder of this rude monument of filial veneration, was engaged
in the memorable border wars at the close of the 16th century,
and was defeated at the battle of Chester in 1607.</p>
<p>It remained erect and entire until the civil wars, when some
of Cromwell&rsquo;s ignorant zealots, mistaking it for some
Popish cross, overthrew and broke it, and it remained for more
than a century in a prostrate state, until the Rev. John Price,
Bodleian Librarian, uncle to the late Dr. Price, formerly of
Llangollen, wrote to Trevor Lloyd, Esq., of Trevor Hall, who,
with praiseworthy zeal, had its mutilated remains reared again
into its base, which had not been removed, and placed upon it
this Latin inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Quod hujus veteris monumenti superest diu ex
oculis remotum et neglectum tandem restituit.&nbsp; T. Lloyd,
Trevor Hall, 1779.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>T. Lloyd, of Trevor Hall, at length, in the year
1779, restored what remains of this ancient monument, that had
been for a long time removed from sight and neglected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cross, or rather Pillar, was formerly twelve feet high,
but at present is little more than eight feet, and is inscribed
all round with letters.&nbsp; It has a round band, resembling a
cord, arranged as if in drapery, round an altar, with a ring in
each compartment, part of which is either broken or worn away,
but the form is clearly defined.&nbsp; The inscription is now
much defaced, but when the monument was restored, the characters
were carefully copied by Mr. Lloyd, the great antiquarian of that
period, who gives them as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Concenn filius Cateli&mdash;Cateli filius
Brochmail<br />
Brochmail filius Eliseg&mdash;Eliseg filius Cnoillaine<br />
Concenn itaque pronepos Eliseg edificavit hunc<br />
Lapidem proavo suo Eliseg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following seems to be the exact translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Concenn, the son of Cateli; Cateli, the son of
Brochmail;<br />
Brochmail, the son of Eliseg; Eliseg, the son of Cnoillaine;<br
/>
Concenn, therefore, the great-grandson of Eliseg, erected this<br
/>
Stone to his great-grandfather Eliseg.</p>
</blockquote>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
